## IDE of choice : 

##### Pros:

    
   - IT has a command pallette (  good for automating repetitive tasks)
   - Developer Tools
   - there's a lot support from Github crew 

##### Cons:
 
   - Slow 
   - You need to use coffeescript to write the packages (don't know python yet)
   - It cannot handle files bigger than a couple MB's
   
##### Personal reason of choice: 
  
   - I've worked with sublime 3 , it's an easy switch, a lot of sublime users talk about switching after atom's beta-run.
